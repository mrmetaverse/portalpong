Here's a concise project overview prompt:

"I'm building a multiplayer platform-physics game inspired by Pong and Spy vs Spy, using Three.js. It's a side-scrolling 1v1 game where players are red and blue circles that can jump between randomly generated platforms and cast short-range spells. The map loops horizontally (go right, appear on left), and there's an oval-shaped goal/portal on each side. A white ball bounces around with no gravity, and players try to score it in the opponent's goal either by touching it or using their spell blasts. The game has a neon color-shifting background with a black cave overlay. I need help setting this up properly and implementing the core mechanics and visual effects. The controls are WASD+E for player 1 and IJKL+O for player 2. Can you help me create and structure this game?"



Here's what we need to continue fixing and implementing for the game:

1. Fix animation loop - it's currently truncated and missing player movement code. Need to complete all player and ball updates.

2. Bug fixes needed:
   - Missing cleanup for THREE.js scene and objects
   - Missing window resize handler
   - Controls need to be fixed (movement directions are mixed up)
   - Missing portal collision side checks

3. Missing features to implement:
   - Ball-platform collisions
   - Ball speed limits
   - Visual feedback for spell casting
   - Screen shake on explosions
   - Goal scoring effects
   - Player spawn points after scoring

4. Code structure improvements:
   - Need to export all class definitions
   - Need proper React hooks for managing game state
   - Need proper TypeScript types
   - Need to handle component unmounting cleanly

5. Performance optimizations:
   - Object pooling for spells and explosions
   - Efficient collision checking
   - Proper render loop management

6. Visual improvements:
   - Better shader for background color transitions
   - More dynamic cave generation
   - Platform appearance and effects
   - Particle effects for spells and goals

7. Game balance:
   - Tune ball physics values
   - Adjust spell radius and lifetime
   - Platform placement rules
   - Jump and movement speeds
